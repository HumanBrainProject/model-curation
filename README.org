#+title: Model curation process

A python module for the model curation process in the HBP. 

It curates entries from their submission in the Model Catalog by the HBP contributors to their publications in the HBP Knowledge Graph. The curation process includes automatic processes of database updates together with manual editing of entries in Google Spreadsheets and email interactions with the model contributors.
